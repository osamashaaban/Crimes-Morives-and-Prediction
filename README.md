# Crimes-Morives-and-Prediction
Crimes have grown so much that the mayors of the most influential states in the United States have asked for help:  Mayors want to know:  The motives for the crimes and whether they have anything to do with age, race, and area. Above all, they ask the Padawan experts to predict, based on an inexpensive regression model, how they can anticipate crime.

I worked on answering these questions:
1- what are the motives for the crimes?
2- whether they have anything to do with age, race, and area?
3- How they can anticipate crime?
Starting from EDA, data preprocessing and features selection based on P-values ending with creating some ML models to help us to anticipate crimes. Then using so analytics to determine the motives for the crimes and whether they have anything to do with age, race, and area.

Model Used for predictions :
1-Linear regression
2-Polynomial regression
3-Ridge regression 
4-XG boost regression
5-Gradient Boosting Regression

Models evalusation metrics :
1- R2 score
2- AIC / BIC
